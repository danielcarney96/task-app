# Charts

You may find some documents in this repo with a strange format such as:

````
```mermaid

Start --> End
````

This syntax is using [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) to create charts and graphs for markdown files. Since graphs are useful, and we primarily use markdown for documentation, it makes sense to combine the two.

To be able to view these charts/graphs, you should install the following VS Code extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid
